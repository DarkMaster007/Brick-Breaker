# brickbreaker
A brick breaker game I made with Borland Graphics (graphics.h lib)

Not really alot to see here other than a brick breaker game. I made a launcher for it to either launch the game or its level editor.
It has a major bug where the ball will just go through the brick and I dont know how to fix that one.
The folder structure is as I uploaded so it always builds to Game/bin.
The program I use is Embarcadero Dev C++.
Either build it or run the exe launcher in Game folder.
