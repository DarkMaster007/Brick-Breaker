# Brick-Breaker
A brick breaker game I made with Borland Graphics (graphics.h lib) originally. Now updated to using Raylib.<br>
- Main branch is where the "stable" version of the game resides.<br>
- Beta branch is where I will probs update first (if I don't forget again...).<br>
- Original branch is where a backup of the first version of the game is kept.<br>
"ESC" - to quit game or editor
